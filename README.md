# 📖 Project Title
**Decentralized Peer Review System**

---

## 📄 Project Description

This smart contract is a prototype of a **Decentralized Peer Review System** built using the Clarity language on the Stacks blockchain. It allows reviewers to submit and retrieve transparent, tamper-proof reviews tied to submission IDs. Reviews are stored on-chain with a rating and a comment, ensuring accountability and immutability.

## 🌟 Project Vision

The goal is to make the academic and research peer review process **transparent**, **decentralized**, and **fair** by:
- Reducing bias and manipulation
- Providing public and permanent access to review data
- Letting researchers validate others’ work with trustless infrastructure

---

## 🔭 Future Scope

In future versions, the system could support:
- Anonymous ZK-based reviews
- Token incentives for fair reviewing
- DAO-based review moderation and dispute resolution
- On-chain submission uploads and audit trails
- Integration with research publishing platforms and NFT citation badges
